Fuck\\ \\ @tfay3 definitely meant Seager there. Ackley can't do shit.\\ \\ Lloyd. I don't care who the hell is on you're team. You don't throw Maurer and Ramirez that many times. Hmm maybe he'll be better this time\\ \\ The only issue with that is i can't feel like a bad ass when i listen to my ipod with my hood on on the way down\\ \\ And the mob is headed to dicks\\ \\ Dear Santa,

Love, Brian\\ \\ My goal for the summer is to never sit on my ass for a whole day \#SoFarSoGood \#LiveLife\\ \\ Reports are bullshit. Or, at least mine usually are\\ \\ Fuck David Stern. Fuck Clay Bennett. Fuck OKC. Fuck Howard Schultz. Fuck Greg Nickels. Fuck Kevin Johnson. Fuck Sacramento. Fuck the NBA.\\ \\ Shame on the person who let their dog shit in front of the 26 stop. But at least ill smell like the average metro bus rider now\\ \\ No matter how chill my weekend is, there's still way too much shit I need to do on Sunday night\\ \\ If we legalize marijuana, maybe Tyrann Mathieu can come play for UW. \#RecruitingPitch\\ \\ Opening ceremony is so damn long. \#Olympics\\ \\ @tfay3 knows how to play though. but ya he's a bitch\\ \\ Karma is coming to bite Clay Bennett in the ass \#MakesMeHappy \#NoSympathy \#SeattleCurse\\ \\ Damn. Can't complain about East Coast bias for a while. No WC teams in S16.\\ \\ damn... http://t.co/3Taeqz6h\\ \\ Damn. @TWroten14 got up. \#SportcenterTopPlay \#dunkface\\ \\ Sunday night homework sucks, but no homework on Saturday is better. \#slackin\\
